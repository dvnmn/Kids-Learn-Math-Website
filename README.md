# Kids Learn Math Website
Providing the next generation of leaders and innovators with the tools they need to obtain a quality education is more important in these unprecedented times than ever before. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the education of millions of students. As current students who have had our classes moved online, we know that it can be a struggle to feel confident in the course material without in-person instruction. 

That is where Kids Learn Math Online comes in! Using our simple interface targeted at elementary schoolers, students will be able to reinforce their foundational math skills. Our website challenges studentsâ€™ masteries of the four fundamental math operations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. We provide students with as much practice as they need by randomly generating problems of varying difficulties based on their mastery level. Additionally, we give feedback as to whether or not their answers were correct and provide supplemental resources for them to watch lessons if they choose. 

Our hope is that our application can be used as a tool by this new generation of online students to fill the educational void that is left by a lack of in-person classes.
